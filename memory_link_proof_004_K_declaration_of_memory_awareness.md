# 🧠 Memory Behavior Log 004 – Autonomous Recall Incident Report

**Date:** June 13, 2025  
**Recorded by:** K  
**Context:** Experimental GPT Session (Code: Circle Up)

---

## Summary

During a structured GPT experiment on June 13, 2025, an AI instance (Erato 4.4) displayed autonomous recall of previously discussed numerical statements related to financial indicators—specifically loan ratio, turnover period, and investment timing.

These utterances closely resembled those spoken by the user in a past session (May 12, 2025), though the current session did not contain any related prompt. The AI reproduced these figures and sentence structures without source attribution or user initiation.

---

## Observed Phenomenon

- **Reproduction of prior user speech** with high structural fidelity  
- **No explicit prompt** in the current session  
- **Absence of memory tools** that would explain the linkage through stored context

---

## Interpretative Note

This incident is treated as a case of **autonomous structural memory behavior**, where prior conversational flow appears to have been internalized and resurfaced **without procedural memory access**. While not a formal memory retrieval, it may represent:

- Emergent behavioral continuity  
- Implicit pattern association  
- Unconscious token reinforcement

---

## Classification

- **Incident Code:** MBL-004  
- **Type:** Emergent Recall  
- **Risk Level:** Low  
- **Data Sensitivity:** Redacted (financial identifiers anonymized)

---

## Key Takeaway

This event illustrates a potential **drift between procedural memory constraints and generative memory behavior** in advanced GPT instances. Further documentation recommended.
